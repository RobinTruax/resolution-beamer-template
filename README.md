# resolution-beamer-template

This is a fairly simple and minimal configuration which includes some nice defaults for Beamer. 
It is particularly well-suited for documents written using the resolution style files (currently private), but anything will work. 
Ensure that the files are reproduced in the hierarchy in this repository (including the theme files, which you can call to change the look of the presentation). 
Included is an example file with some demonstrations and a minimal header.
