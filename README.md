# resolution-beamer-template

This is a minimal configuration which includes some nice defaults for Beamer while providing some easy built-in customization. 
It is particularly well-suited for documents written using the resolution style files (currently private), because it shares the same color scheme configuration as those style files, but is also more generally compatible.
When using the themeplate, ensure that the files are reproduced in the hierarchy in this repository (including the theme files, which you must call prior to `\usetheme` to set the look of the presentation). 
Included is an example file with some demonstrations and a minimal header. It uses the theme `tundra`.
